== Your Git History Is A Mess

One solution : Interactif Rebase.

```
git rebase -i HEAD~<NUMBER OF COMMITS YOU WANT TO REWORK>
```

Number of commits between two branches :

```
git log --oneline <CURRENT BRANCH> ^<BRANCH TO COMPARE WITH> | wc -l
```

=== Rebase Compared To A Branch

```
git rebase <THE BRANCH YOU WANT TO REBASE TO>
```

=== Rewrite Old Commit Messages

```
git rebase -i HEAD~<NUMBER OF COMMITS YOU WANT TO REWORK>
```

Mark the commits you want to rewrite with *reword* instead of *pick*.

=== Condense Commits

Mark the commits you want to fuse into other commits with *squash* instead of *pick*.

=== You Are Out Of Sync With Work Done By Others And Don't Want To Manage Conflicts

```
git checkout <YOUR BRANCH>
git reset origin/<YOUR BRANCH> --hard
```

*BEWARE :* Your recent work on this branch will be lost!
