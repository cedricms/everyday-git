== Something More Important Has Come Up

Put your unstable work aside.

=== Stash

Stash if you are not ready to commit :

```
git stash save <description>
```

=== List Your Stashes

```
git stash list
```

=== View The Content Of A Stash

List the files in first stash :

```
git stash show stash@{0}
```

=== Pop

Retrieve the second stash :

```
git stash pop stash@{1}
```

=== Remove All Stashes

```
git stash clear
```

=== Delete A Stash

Delete the third stash :

```
git stash drop stash@{2}
```

=== Or just commit

Yet again, you are on your own branch, you can rewrite your Git history after; more on that later ;) .
